# Exploring Computer Science

**Decoding the machines that run our world.**

A subsection of [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io), this site documents my journey through the Computer Science curriculum. It transforms raw lecture notes into structured, teaching-focused articles designed to explain *why* things work, not just *how*.
