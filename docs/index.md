# Welcome to Exploring Computer Science

A subsection of [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io), this site documents my journey through Computer Science concepts as I work toward my degree.

This isn't just a collection of notes - it's a teaching-focused resource. Writing to explain concepts reinforces learning and creates something useful for others exploring the same topics.

## What You'll Find Here

### Building Blocks

The foundation of computer science:

- **[What is Computer Science?](building_blocks/what_is_computer_science.md)** - The field beyond the code
- **[Computational Thinking](building_blocks/computational_thinking.md)** - How to approach problems like a computer scientist
- **[Finite State Machines](building_blocks/finite_state_machines.md)** - Modeling systems with states and transitions
- **[Recursive Transition Networks](building_blocks/recursive_transition_networks.md)** - Parsing natural language structures
- **[Backus-Naur Form](building_blocks/backus_naur_form.md)** - Formal grammar notation for defining languages
- **[Regular Expressions](building_blocks/regular_expressions.md)** - Pattern matching and text processing
- **[How Parsers Work](building_blocks/how_parsers_work.md)** - From tokens to syntax trees
- **[Binary Trees & Representation](building_blocks/binary_trees_and_representation.md)** - Tree structures and data representation
- **[Scheme & Parse Trees](building_blocks/scheme_and_parse_trees.md)** - Understanding expression parsing and prefix notation

### Data Structures

Organizing and managing data:

- **[Abstract Data Types & Stacks](data_structures/abstract_data_types_and_stack.md)** - LIFO data structures and abstraction

### Coming Soon

**More Building Blocks:**

- Procedures & Higher-Order Functions - Abstraction and functional programming

**New Sections:**

- **Algorithms** - Big-O notation, Turing machines, sorting and searching
- **Programming** - Paradigms, OOP, interpreters vs compilers
- **Systems** - Operating systems, networks, databases
- **Modern Topics** - AI, security, ethics in computing

## About This Project

This site grows alongside my coursework. Each article synthesizes multiple sources into a cohesive explanation with diagrams, code examples, and practice problems.

The goal: if someone asks me to explain a concept, I should be able to point them here.
