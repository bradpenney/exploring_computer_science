# Ethics in Computing

In the early days of computer science, the primary focus was: *"Is this possible?"* Today, the question has shifted to: *"Is this right?"*

As software becomes integrated into every aspect of our lives—from healthcare and banking to policing and education—the ethical decisions made by programmers have a massive impact on society. **Computer Ethics** is the study of the moral guidelines that govern the use of computers and information systems.

## 1. Algorithmic Bias

A common myth is that computers are "objective" and "neutral." However, a computer is only as good as its training data.

If an AI system is trained on data that contains historical human bias, the system will learn and amplify that bias. This is called **Algorithmic Bias**.

-   **Example:** A facial recognition system that works perfectly on light-skinned faces but fails on dark-skinned faces because it was trained primarily on photos of the former.
-   **Impact:** This can lead to discrimination in hiring, loan approvals, and even criminal sentencing.

## 2. Privacy and Surveillance

In the digital age, data is the new oil. Companies and governments collect vast amounts of information about our location, our searches, our health, and our conversations.

The ethical dilemma is the **Privacy vs. Convenience Trade-off**. 
-   We get free maps and search engines, but in exchange, we are tracked 24/7.
-   **Mass Surveillance:** Using AI to track entire populations raises fundamental questions about freedom and human rights.

## 3. The Digital Divide

As technology becomes a requirement for participation in society (e.g., online banking, digital education), the gap between those who have access to high-speed internet and computers and those who don't—the **Digital Divide**—becomes a major ethical issue.

If we don't ensure equal access, technology becomes a tool that increases social and economic inequality.

## 4. Automation and the Future of Work

Artificial Intelligence and robotics are capable of performing tasks that once required human labor—from factory work to legal analysis.

-   **The Positive:** Increased efficiency and freeing humans from dangerous or boring tasks.
-   **The Ethical Concern:** Mass displacement of workers. How does society support those whose jobs have been "automated away"?

## 5. Intellectual Property

In a world where software can be copied perfectly for zero cost, how do we protect the work of creators? 
-   **Open Source:** Is it an ethical duty to share code for the benefit of all?
-   **Copyright:** Should a company be allowed to own a specific algorithm forever?

## Practice Problems

??? question "Practice Problem 1: Identifying Bias"

    A company uses an AI to screen resumes. The AI notices that, historically, the most successful employees lived in a specific wealthy neighborhood, so it starts automatically rejecting candidates from other neighborhoods. Is this an ethical issue?

    ??? tip "Solution"
        **Yes.** 
        
        This is a classic example of **Algorithmic Bias**. The AI is using "neighborhood" as a proxy for wealth and race, leading to unfair discrimination against qualified candidates based on where they live, rather than their skills.

??? question "Practice Problem 2: Privacy"

    A school installs software on students' laptops that uses the webcam to watch their eyes during exams to prevent cheating. What is the ethical concern here?

    ??? tip "Solution"
        **Privacy and Surveillance.**
        
        While the goal (preventing cheating) is understandable, the method involves invasive surveillance of students in their private homes. It also raises concerns about **Algorithmic Bias**, as some students might have different eye movements due to medical conditions or neurodiversity.

## Key Takeaways

| Issue | Core Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Bias** | Does the system treat everyone fairly? |
| **Privacy** | Who owns your data and who can see it? |
| **Access** | Does everyone have the opportunity to use this? |
| **Labor** | How does this change the lives of workers? |

Software engineering is not just about writing code; it is about building the infrastructure of human society. Every line of code carries an ethical weight. As a "System Mage," your responsibility is to ensure that your "magic" serves the common good and protects the vulnerable.
